### Explore US Bikeshare Data

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used. 

<b>Explore US Bikeshare Data</b> is project that was created to make a tool that allows its users to get analytical and statistical data of bike-sharing in different cities. 
Data which used in this project were provided by <a href="https://www.motivateco.com/">Motivate</a>, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States.

#### The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

<ul>
    <li>Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)</li>
    <li>End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)</li>
    <li>Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)</li>
    <li>Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)</li>
    <li>End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)</li>
    <li>User Type (Subscriber or Customer)</li>
</ul>

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

<ul>
    <li>Gender</li>
    <li>Birth Year</li>
</ul>
